TextRPClient
============

This is my own personal project called OpenRP. Essentially, the final goal of the project is to have an open source server/client for players to use to role play with each other.

The idea is based off of Furcadia, a relatively old, closed-source, role-playing game. However, while Furcadia has a grphical element, this game is intended to be more text-based. Judging by my observations on how Furcadia is used however, it would seem that a large portion of the players on there could find this software useful for their RPing.

In any case though, whether or not this actually gets used, it's more of a learning experience for me.
